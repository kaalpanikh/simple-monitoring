# Simple Monitoring Project

## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive monitoring dashboard using Netdata, following the requirements from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/simple-monitoring-dashboard). The goal is to help you learn the basics of system monitoring, understand how to monitor system health, and get acquainted with real-time performance tracking.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Dashboard Setup Using Netdata
- [x] Install Netdata on a Linux system
- [x] Configure Netdata to monitor core system metrics:
  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage
  - Disk I/O
- [x] Access the Netdata dashboard via web browser
- [x] Customize dashboard aspects (add/modify charts)
- [x] Set up alerts (e.g., CPU usage > 80%)

### 2. Custom Process Monitoring
- [x] Implemented process-specific monitoring:
  - System processes (sshd, netdata)
  - Web services (nginx, apache, httpd)
  - Database services (mysql, postgresql, mongodb)
  - Custom services (docker, containerd, kubelet)
- [x] Configured detailed metrics for each process:
  - CPU usage percentage
  - Memory usage (private and RSS)
  - Process status and uptime
  - Thread count
  - File descriptors

### 3. Automation & Scripting
- [x] setup.sh: Automates Netdata installation and custom configuration
- [x] test_dashboard.sh: Tests monitoring dashboard
- [x] cleanup.sh: Removes Netdata agent

### 4. Implemented Scripts

#### Setup Script (setup.sh)
- Automates Netdata installation on Amazon Linux
- Configures basic system monitoring
- Sets up CPU usage alerts
- Enables dashboard access
- Configures custom process monitoring
- Sets proper permissions for configuration files

#### Test Script (test_dashboard.sh)
- Generates test loads:
  - CPU stress testing
  - Disk I/O operations
  - Memory usage simulation
- Verifies monitoring functionality
- Checks alert triggering

#### Cleanup Script (cleanup.sh)
- Removes Netdata installation
- Cleans up configuration files
- Removes test tools
- Verifies complete removal
